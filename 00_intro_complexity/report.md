## Observation
Even simple algorithms become unusable as complexity increases.
Exponential growth makes correctness meaningless in practice.

## AI Insight
In AI, the primary constraint is not model correctness,
but computational feasibility under realistic scale.

## Reflection
This explains why AI systems rely on approximation,
heuristics, and architectural constraints.
