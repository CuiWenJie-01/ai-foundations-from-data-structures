# AI Foundations from Data Structures

This repository develops **long-term AI foundational understanding**
by systematically mapping concepts from
**《数据结构（邓俊辉）》**
to core AI capabilities.

The focus is not on building engineering systems or tuning models,
but on cultivating **structural intuition** for AI:
representation, reasoning, search, memory, and information organization.

---

## Scope & Non-Goals

### This repository focuses on:
- Understanding how data structures shape AI behavior
- Building intuition for scalability, feasibility, and abstraction
- Connecting classical CS foundations to modern AI systems

### This repository does NOT aim to:
- Implement production-grade systems
- Optimize performance or benchmarks
- Serve as a tutorial for specific AI frameworks

---

## How This Repository Works

- Each folder corresponds to **one chapter** of the book
- Each chapter contains:
  - `README.md` — concept mapping (Data Structure → AI capability)
  - `experiment.py` — minimal, runnable experiment
  - `report.md` — reflection and insights (personal but structured)

Experiments are intentionally **small and focused**,
designed to reveal principles rather than implementation details.

## Completion Criteria

A chapter is considered **complete** only if:
- `README.md` clearly explains the Data Structure → AI mapping
- `experiment.py` runs successfully and demonstrates the core idea
- `report.md` contains non-trivial reflection and insight

## Who This Is For

- AI / Algorithm-oriented learners
- Practitioners strengthening foundational understanding
- Anyone interested in *why* AI systems work,
  not just *how* to use them
